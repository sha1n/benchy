# Benchy
`benchy` is a CLI benchmarking tool that allows you to easily compare performance metrics of different CLI commands. I developed this tool to benchmark and compare development tools and configurations on different environment setups and machine over time. It is designed to support complex scenarios that require high level of control and consistency.
